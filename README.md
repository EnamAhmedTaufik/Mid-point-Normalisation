## üìù Abstract
Enhancing diseases detection in plant leaf remains a chal- lenge, particularly with limited data and complex contextual factors. In this work, we present a two-step approach, starting with Mid Point Normalization (MPN) for image preprocess- ing, followed by an attention mechanism to enhance feature recalibration. As a downstream classification task, combining MPN with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block achieves a high accuracy of 93%, with balanced class-wise performance. Notably, a perfect F1 score for a particular targeted class demonstrates the effectiveness of attention in dynamic feature refinement. For segmentation, integrating the same attention block into the U-Net architecture with MPN-preprocessed images resulted in substantial improvements, yielding a Dice score of 72.44% and an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 58.54%, surpassing the baseline U-Net. Our experiments not only delivered higher accuracies but also produced effi- cient, lightweight, and robust models suitable for real-world computer vision applications.
